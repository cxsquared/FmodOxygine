# FmodOxygine

This is an implementation of a baisc audio engine using FMOD Studio as the middleware. This project is using the [Oxygine](http://oxygine.org/) framework but the audio engine can work in any project.

I built to hopefully serve as a helping tool for anyone wanting to get into audio programming. You can check out tutorials on implementing FMOD into you projects on my website [CodyClaborn.me](http://codyclaborn.me/). If you have any questions or issues feel free to post an issue and I'll gladly help you out.
